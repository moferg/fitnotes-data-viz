# FitNotes Data Visualizer

This script will take in a CSV file generated by the FitNotes mobile workout tracking app and output charts and graphs to guide the user to a more data driven workout.

## Requirements

This script requires both the numpy and matplotlib libraries. They can be installed seperately with these two commands: `pip install numpy` and `pip install matplotlib`. However, matplotlib is built using numpy, so if you install matplotlib first then numpy should then be installed as a prerequisite. 

## Using This Script

The script runs on the command line. To use the script, clone this GitHub repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run one of the following commands depending on your operating system: `python fitnotes_data_viz.py` on Windows or `python3 fitnotes_data_viz.py` on Mac on Linux.
