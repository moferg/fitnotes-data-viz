# FitNotes Data Visualizer

This script will take in a CSV file generated by the FitNotes mobile workout tracking app and output charts and graphs to guide the user to a more data driven workout.

## Requirements

The main libraries used in this script are matplotlib and numpy. If these libraries are already installed on your machine, feel free to continue to the next section. If you would like to use a virtual environment to store these libraries, run one of the following commands: `python -m venv .venv` on Windows or `python3 -m venv .venv` on Mac or Linux. Then, to install the required libraries for this script, run one of the following commands: `pip install -r requirements.txt` on Windows or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` on Mac or Linux.  

## Using This Script

The script runs on the command line. To use the script, clone this GitHub repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run one of the following commands: `python fitnotes_data_viz.py` on Windows or `python3 fitnotes_data_viz.py` on Mac or Linux.

## Features List

The following features have been implemented to meet the requirements outlined in the Python Project Requirements document:
1. Read data from an external CSV file
2. Created a list and used it in the program
3. Created 3 unit tests for the application
4. Used matplotlib to visualize data in a graph
